# To-do List Agent Design

## Overview
The To-do List Agent is a command-line interface (CLI) application that allows users to manage their to-do tasks. The agent provides functionalities to add, view, and delete tasks from the to-do list. The application is built using the `click` library for creating the CLI and `unittest` for testing.

## CLI Commands
The following commands are available in the To-do List Agent:

### Add Task
Adds a new task to the to-do list.

**Usage:**
```
python src/agent.py add [TASK]
```

**Example:**
```
python src/agent.py add "Buy groceries"
```

### View Tasks
Displays all tasks in the to-do list.

**Usage:**
```
python src/agent.py view
```

**Example:**
```
python src/agent.py view
```

### Delete Task
Deletes a task from the to-do list by its number.

**Usage:**
```
python src/agent.py delete [TASK_NUMBER]
```

**Example:**
```
python src/agent.py delete 1
```

## Testing
Unit tests for the CLI commands are implemented using the `unittest` framework. The tests cover the following scenarios:
- Adding a task
- Viewing tasks
- Deleting a task
- Deleting an invalid task

The tests can be run using the following command:
```
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## Future Enhancements
- Editing tasks
- Marking tasks as completed
- Saving and loading tasks from a file
- Adding due dates and priorities to tasks
- Categorizing tasks
- Visual representation of tasks (e.g., task board)
- Task search and filtering
- Task reminders and notifications
